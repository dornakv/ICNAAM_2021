The machine conceptually implements the following idea: input vectors are non-linearly mapped to a very high-dimension feature space. In this feature space a linear decision surface is constructed. Special properties of the decision surface ensures high generalization ability of the learning machine. The idea behind the support-vector network was previously implemented for the restricted case where the training data can be separated without errors. We here extend this result to non-separable training data.},

  abstract  = {This paper deals with the novel PermonSVM machine learning tool. PermonSVM is a part of our PERMON toolbox. It implements the linear two-class Support Vector Machines. PermonSVM is built on top of PermonQP (PERMON module for quadratic programming) which in turn uses PETSc. The main advantage of PermonSVM is that it is parallel. The parallelism comes from a distribution of matrices and vectors. The MPRGP algorithm, implemented in PermonQP, is used as a solver of the quadratic programming problem arising from the dual SVM formulation. The scalability of MPRGP was proven in problems of mechanics with more than billion of unknowns solved on tens of thousands of cores. Apart from the scalability of our approach, we also investigate the relations between training rate, hyperplane margin, the value of the dual functional, and the norm of the projected gradient.},
